        <p>Warming up, stretching and cooling down correctly are fundamental, yet often 
        overlooked parts of any training program. While these components to training 
        are very basic, many people tend to skip over a proper warm-up, stretch and 
        cool down program and wonder why they do not feel ready to work out. I call 
        these aspects of training the forgotten elements of training because they are 
        techniques that you never see much of in gyms compared to the amount of work 
        done on heavy sets you see.<br/><br/>
        Warming up has many benefits. The main benefit to warming up is injury 
        prevention because the blood will be pumping to an area, lowering the chance 
        of a muscle pull or joint injury. Warming up isn't just a safety precaution 
        though - it also has positive effects on a bodybuilder because after a warm-up, 
        strength and focus should be peaked. Warming up has many physical and mental 
        benefits.<br/><br/>

        Stretching and cooling down go hand-in-hand mostly because they come after a 
        workout, whereas a warm up usually precedes a workout. Their main benefit is 
        increasing recovery, and these activities also add to the overall health of 
        the muscles.This article will not only discuss the many ways in which a warm-up, 
        stretch and cool down program is important, but it will also provide some methods 
        to warming up, stretching and cooling down and some useful tips on how to do a 
        proper but time-efficient warm-up!<br/><br/>

        While it will focus on warming up for a hardcore hypertrophy-inducing workout 
        with weights, this article will also give methods of warming up for other 
        activities such as athletic activities, a strength workout, or an endurance 
        workout, and methods for a cool down and stretch that will maximize recovery 
        and progress!

          An Injured Bodybuilder Can't Gain Mass!
        </h1>
        <p>
        An injury is the last thing any bodybuilder wants. You can miss a meal here and there if you absolutely must, you can skip the last 5 minutes of your cardio session if you need to be somewhere, but if you skip your warm-up and end up with a muscle pull, you're not gaining optimally for the next month or so.<br/><br/>
        Warming up is injury-preventative in many ways. It increases flexibility and blood flow which limits the chance of a muscle pull and joint pain. A proper warm-up also gets the lifter in a groove for their exercise.

        <h2>Increasing Flexibility</h2>
        <p>
        Warming up is a great way to increase flexibility before a heavy set. Training the muscles through an identical range of motion to the lift that is to be done stretches the muscle properly and prevents a pull of any muscle about to be trained.<br/><br/>
        Let's say a lifter is getting their legs ready for a set of full barbell squats, 355 pounds for 5 reps. They get into the gym and their legs are a bit tight. They head over to the squat rack and get under the bar. They squat down and can hardly get to parallel. Luckily, they can push a light weight back up.
        </p>

        <p>
        If they had skipped a warm-up and jumped right into 355 pounds, it would have pushed their legs past the maximum stretch point and chances are a muscle pull would result.
        </p>
        <h2>Lubricating The Joints</h2>
        <p>
        So the same lifter decides to hit the treadmill for 3 minutes to get the blood and oxygen pumping into their legs. When he gets back to the squat rack with his warm-up weight, he finds himself much more flexible. After twelve warm-up reps his knees are completely lubricated as well, and there is no cracking or popping to be heard.
        </p>
        <h2>"Getting Into The Groove"</h2>
        <p>
        Getting into the groove for an exercise is also important. Take as many sets as you need until the form for an exercise feels natural. Once all the kinks are worked out, a proper warm up has been completed. So, let's get started!

        <h2>Warming Up For Optimal Results</h2>
        <p>A lot of times a lifter will get to the gym and get right into their heavy sets with no warm-up. Then they come on Bodybuilding.com and read this article. "Okay, I'll do one warm-up with the bar, that will help a lot I guess". Maybe it helped a little bit but a proper warm-up can do you a lot better.</p>
